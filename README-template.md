# Frontend Mentor - Chat app CSS illustration solution

This is a solution to the [Chat app CSS illustration challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/chat-app-css-illustration-O5auMkFqY). Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects. 

## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the component depending on their device's screen size
- **Bonus**: See the chat interface animate on the initial load


## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

I've actually always thought of how the UI of chat apps were created but never really had the confidence or would I say time to think about it that much, just had it my mind it's one those advanced concepts I'd learn later...
But this projects actually made it easier to visualize even though there's no interactivity yet but I was able to take a step in doing something I was too scared to think of.
